    <h1>Dear Relative</h1>

<h3>Hope this letter finds you well. We're super excited about the upcoming wedding of our cousin in Abuja, Nigeria. It's going to be a beautiful traditional ceremony with colorful outfits, fantastic food, and great celebrations. We'll have Igbo cultural dances, music from top Nigerian artists like Flavour, and lots of laughter. The wedding will showcase the rich traditions of Nigeria with foods like okazi soup, pounded yam, and jollof rice - definitely a feast for the senses!

The wedding ceremony will take place at a lovely venue in Abuja with family and friends coming from all over Nigeria. Everyone's buzzing with excitement about the event. Our cousin's fiancé(e) is from a lovely family too, so it's going to be a big celebration of love, culture, and family bonding. We'll have traditional wedding attire, music, dances, and plenty of Nigerian hospitality.

We wish you could join us for the wedding! It'll be a weekend full of joy, family, and festivities. We're all looking forward to it. If you can't make it physically, we'll definitely send you photos and updates so you can feel part of the celebration from afar.

How have you been? What have you been up to lately? We've missed you here in Nigeria. Let us know how life's treating you.

Looking forward to catching up soon.</h3>
