   <h1> Dear Friend</h1>

<h3>Hope you're doing fantastically! I wanted to tell you about the incredible cultural festival we had here in Nigeria recently. We had the Ojude Oba festival in Ijebu, and it was absolutely mind-blowing! The festival showcased so much of our rich Nigerian culture - colorful traditional outfits, energetic dances, mouthwatering local food like jollof rice, pepper soup, and suya, and nonstop music with Afrobeats DJs getting everyone dancing like crazy.

The festival was held in a big open field with lots of activities like cultural displays, horse racing (which is a big part of Ojude Oba!), and traditional Yoruba performances. People came from all over Nigeria to join in the fun. We wore our best traditional attire - I went with a classic agbada and cap, looking sharp 😎 - and everyone looked stunning. The vibe was electric with laughter, music, and celebrations everywhere. We had stalls selling local crafts, food, and clothing, adding to the festive atmosphere.

One of the highlights was the horse racing event. The horses were decked out in colorful gear, and the riders showed off their skills in traditional attire. The crowd cheered as they raced down the track. Then there were cultural dances - like the energetic Bata dance - performed by groups in traditional costumes. Everyone was clapping and joining in. We also had top Nigerian musicians perform live, playing hits from Wizkid, Davido, and Tiwa Savage.

I wish you were there to experience it with me! We missed having you to share the excitement and cultural richness of the festival. Next year maybe we'll plan for you to come during one of our big cultural festivals like Egunje or Durbar. You'll love the energy and traditions here. Nigeria's got so much cultural wealth, and festivals like these show it off big time.

How have you been? What have you been up to lately? I'd love to catch up more when you have time. Do you have any plans to visit Nigeria soon? We'd love to have you here.

Looking forward to hearing from you.</h3>
