   <h1><p> Dear Relative Abroad</p></h1>
<h3>
Hope this letter finds you well! We've missed you so much here in Nigeria. Since you've been away, we've had tons of fun, and I'm writing to tell you about all the exciting things you missed.

First off, the cultural festivals were lit! We had amazing Egunje festivals in Lagos, colorful Ojude Oba in Ijebu, and vibrant Durbar festivals in the North. The food was 🔥🔥🔥 - plenty of jollof rice, suya, and pepper soup.

We also had some crazy sports action. The Super Eagles played some thrilling matches, and we cheered them on big time! On the streets, Afrobeats was everywhere - Davido, Burna Boy, and Tiwa Savage had us dancing nonstop.

In tech news, startups in Lagos were buzzing. We heard about fintech innovations like Paystack (you know how big they're getting in Africa!).

We wish you were here to experience all this fun with us! When are you coming back? We miss having you around for parties, braiiis, and chowing down good Nigerian food 😋.

Write back soon and let us know how life's treating you abroad.</h3>
